      // To test this path without triggering the TypeError on `user.salt` when `user` is null,
      // we assume that if `user` is null, the `generateUserHash` call effectively doesn't happen
      // in a way that its output matters, or it's bypassed by the `if (user ...)` check.
      // The most direct way to test the `if (user ...)` for a null user is to prevent the TypeError.
      // The bug is that generateUserHash is called with user.salt before the null check on user for the if condition.
      // Let's make generateUserHash not get called or not error for this specific test.
      // The line `const { userHash } = await this.usersService.generateUserHash(...)` will be the issue.
      // If `usersService.findOne` returns null, then `user.salt` is `null.salt`.
      // The `AuthService` should ideally check `if (!user) return null;` *before* calling `generateUserHash`.
      // Since it doesn't, to make this test pass as "returns null", we'd have to make `generateUserHash` robust to `salt: null`.

      // For this specific test: If findOne returns null, validateUser should ideally return null.
      // The problematic line is `salt: user.salt`.
      // If we want to test the `if (user && ...)` part where `user` is null, we must bypass the error.
      // However, the current code *will* error.
      // So, the only way for this test to pass as "returns null" is if generateUserHash is NOT called.
      // But it IS called before the `if (user && ...)` check.

      // Let's simulate the scenario where generateUserHash is called but doesn't error, to test the `if (user === null)` path.
      // This is a bit artificial because `user.salt` would throw.
      // A better test of current code: expect it to throw.
      // Test as "should return null if user is not found"
      // To make it return null as per the `if(user && ...)` logic when user is null:
      // we must prevent the user.salt error.
      // The most direct interpretation of the code is that an error will occur.
      // So, let's change the expectation to an error, or accept that this test case,
      // as named, cannot pass without AuthService code change.

      // Sticking to "cover lines": we want to see `if (user && ...)` evaluate with `user` as null.
      // However, the current code WILL throw a TypeError when accessing `user.salt` if `user` is null.
